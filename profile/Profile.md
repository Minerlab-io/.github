   Minerlab builds infrastructure and tooling for crypto mining and node operations.
   This organization hosts our internal codebases for:

   - Mining infrastructure
   - Node management
   - Miner software and tooling

   All repositories are private and intended for Minerlab engineers and collaborators.

   ## Focus Areas

   ### Mining Infrastructure

   We maintain a mining monorepo that includes:

   - Miner and pool components
   - Deployment and operations tooling
   - Monitoring, alerting, and basic automation

   The goal is to make it straightforward to run and operate mining setups in a repeatable way.

   ### Node Management (NodeOP / Litenode)

   Our node‑oriented projects focus on:

   - Running and monitoring nodes for supported chains
   - Managing node fleets (provisioning, updates, health checks)
   - Handling uptime, synchronization, and basic protection at the infrastructure level

   These repositories provide the building blocks for running nodes in a more controlled and observable way.

   ### Miner Software & Tools

   We also work on:

   - Miner clients and related tooling
   - Management utilities for configuring and updating miners
   - Integrations between miners, pools, and node infrastructure

   Most of this code is tailored to our own environments and operational requirements.

   - Request access to the repositories relevant to your project.
   - Start with the `README` and `/docs` (if present) in the repo you’re assigned to.
   - Follow our organization‑wide conventions and tooling, documented internally.
